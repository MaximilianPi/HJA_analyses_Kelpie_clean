The folder '01_HJA_scripts' contains all the scripts for bioinformatics (subfolders 01 to 06), extracting GIS and other environmental variables (subfolders 06 and 07), joint species distribution model (subfolder 08), and post model analysis (visualization of species distributions, subfolder 09). To be noticed, some intermediate files related to environmental variables extaction are not in the repo due to their large sizes. The majority of the scripts are run in bash and r.

The folder '02_Kelpie-maps' has the result of bioinformatics, and '03_format_data' has some of the data of environmental variable extraction and thoes are needed for distribution modelling. The foler '04_Output' contains the results of model fitting and visualizing species distributions. The folder '05_supplement' contains data and figures that are listed in the supplementary information of the paper.

Dependencies of softwares and packages used are listed in the README files in the respected subfolders in '01_HJA_scripts'
